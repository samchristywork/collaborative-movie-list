## Overview

This is a simple web app that will allow my SO and me to keep and collaborate
on a list of movies to watch. It will run on a VPS behind an Nginx proxy.

When it is running, uses can add new movies to the list by clicking the "Add
Movie" button, and toggle a strikethrough line by clicking on the item in
question.

## Setup

To run this server you first need to install all of the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Then, start the server with:

```
node main.js
```

## Dependencies

You'll need to have Node.js installed for this to work.

```
nodejs
npm
```
